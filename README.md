Stand up Apache Spark on any machine using Vagrant.  Also includes some sample jobs for Word Count, and for log file processing.

Dependencies:

[VirtualBox](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
Vagrant


These jobs are designed to be run from within the spark console (as opposed to using spark-submit).

Vagrant configuration information is from: http://thegrimmscientist.com/2014/12/01/vagrant-tutorial-spark-in-a-vm/ which references 
Spark version 1.1.  All 1.1 references in that blog post should be changed to the current Spark version which as of 
Feb 2015 is 1.2.
