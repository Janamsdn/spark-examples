Stand up Apache Spark on any machine using Vagrant.  Also includes some sample jobs for Word Count, and for log file processing.

Vagrant is a front-end for VirtualBox, and allows the easy creation and launching of virtual machines on any platform.  The included VagrantFile here will create and completely configure a Linux VM with Apache Spark.

Please see the Vagrant site for further details about Vagrant.

Dependencies:

- [Install Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
- [Install VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

1. Clone this repository
2. Run **vagrant up**.  This will take a while as software is downloaded and installed.  You will then have a running VM but you won't be connected to it yet.
3. Run **vagrant ssh** to connect to your VM
4. **cd spark-1.1.0-bin-hadoop1**  (your version may vary e.g. spark-1.2.0-bin-hadoop1)
5. **bin/spark-shell**
6. You are now in the spark-shell environment
7. **:load /vagrant_data/http_logs.scala**  (will run that script)
8. After quite a bit of output you will see the program results

The results will look something like this:

(940,/french/competition/matchstat8860.htm)

(934,/english/competition/matchprog8860.htm)

(932,/)

(890,/french/index.html)

(849,/english/competition/matchstat8860.htm)

(339,/english/frntpage.htm)

...

These jobs are designed to be run from within the spark console (as opposed to using spark-submit).

Vagrant configuration information is from: http://thegrimmscientist.com/2014/12/01/vagrant-tutorial-spark-in-a-vm/ which references 
Spark version 1.1.  All 1.1 references in that blog post should be changed to the current Spark version which as of 
Feb 2015 is 1.2.
